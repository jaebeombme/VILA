<HD-Glio(args)>
Modality: MRI, 
Task: segmentation, 
Overview: A deep learning-based model designed for high-grade glioma segmentation in brain MR images. HD-Glio leverages ensemble 3D U-Net architectures and robust preprocessing including brain extraction, intensity normalization, and co-registration. It is tailored to identify and delineate tumor subregions (enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor) with high accuracy.
Accuracy: Tumor core (TC): 0.860 - Whole tumor (WT): 0.910 - Enhancing tumor (ET): 0.800 - Average: 0.857
Valid args are: None\n
<MPS(args)>
Modality: MRI
Task: classification
Overview: A deep learning-based classification model that predicts the MRI sequence type (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR, T1CE) from input MR images. It is designed to automatically annotate sequence labels for unlabeled MR scans, improving downstream processing and dataset curation. The model was trained on a diverse multi-institutional dataset covering common brain imaging protocols with varying acquisition parameters.
Accuracy:
T1: 94.2%
T2: 95.8%
FLAIR: 93.7%
T1CE: 92.1%
Average: 92.7%
Valid args are: None\n
